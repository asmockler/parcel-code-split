      <h1>CHAPTER TWO</h1>

      <h2>A MERRY CHRISTMAS</h2>

      <p>
        Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No
        stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much
        disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because
        it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered her mother's
        promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little
        crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful
        old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true
        guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey. She woke Meg with a
        "Merry Christmas," and bade her see what was under her pillow. A
        green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few
        words written by their mother, which made their one present very
        precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage and find
        their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and all sat
        looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the
        coming day.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,
        which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her
        very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Girls," said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to
        the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, "Mother wants us to
        read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used
        to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all this war
        trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you
        please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a little
        every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help
        me through the day."
      </p>

      <p>
        Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her
        and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so
        seldom seen on her restless face.
      </p>

      <p>
        "How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the
        hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,"
        whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'
        example.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm glad mine is blue," said Amy. and then the rooms were very still
        while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to
        touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Where is Mother?" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for
        their gifts, half an hour later.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your ma went
        straight off to see what was needed. There never was such a woman for
        givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin'," replied Hannah, who
        had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them
        all more as a friend than a servant.
      </p>

      <p>
        "She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything
        ready," said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a
        basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.
        "Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?" she added, as the little flask
        did not appear.
      </p>

      <p>
        "She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on
        it, or some such notion," replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the
        first stiffness off the new army slippers.
      </p>

      <p>
        "How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed
        them for me, and I marked them all myself," said Beth, looking proudly
        at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Bless the child! She's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.
        March'. How funny!" cried Jo, taking one up.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Isn't that right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's
        initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,"
        said Beth, looking troubled.
      </p>

      <p>
        "It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for
        no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know," said
        Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.
      </p>

      <p>
        "There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick!" cried Jo, as a door slammed
        and steps sounded in the hall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters
        all waiting for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?" asked Meg,
        surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so
        early.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean anyone should know till the time
        came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave
        all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any
        more."
      </p>

      <p>
        As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap
        one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget
        herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her 'a
        trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to
        ornament the stately bottle.
      </p>

      <p>
        "You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about
        being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the
        minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now."
      </p>

      <p>
        Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the
        girls to the table, eager for breakfast.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books. We read
        some, and mean to every day," they all cried in chorus.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope
        you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far
        away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six
        children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have
        no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to
        tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give
        them your breakfast as a Christmas present?"
      </p>

      <p>
        They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a
        minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, "I'm
        so glad you came before we began!"
      </p>

      <p>
        "May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?" asked
        Beth eagerly.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I shall take the cream and the muffings," added Amy, heroically giving
        up the article she most liked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one
        big plate.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I thought you'd do it," said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. "You
        shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and
        milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime."
