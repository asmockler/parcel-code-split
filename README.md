# Parcel code splitting

This repo is just for me to better understand how different methods of code splitting behave with parcel. Each directory is a simple project that employs a different method of code splitting along with the build output stats in a `README`.

For each project, you can check it out by running `yarn install` in the project folder and then either `yarn start` or `yarn build` for a dev server or to run a build, respectively.
